/**
 * What does WPGancio do?
 * This plugin connects a user of a gancio instance to a Wordpress user so that events published
 * on Wordpress are automatically inserted.
 * It requires an event manager plugin, only Event Organiser (https://wp-event-organiser.com/) is
 * supported until now but to add another plugin it's easy.
